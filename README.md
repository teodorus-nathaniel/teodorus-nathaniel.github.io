# Project Overview
This project is made purely with html, css, js without any third party library (except webpack for bundling).
To run this project, you need to have `webpack` and `webpack-cli` installed globally.
To serve the HTML, it is recommended using live server extension from vscode (ritwickdey.LiveServer),
but any file serving utility can work just fine (eg. `serve` package)

## Run in Development mode
`webpack --watch --mode=development`
run live server

## Run in Production mode
`webpack`
run live server
